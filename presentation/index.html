					<h3>RS Clone</h3>

					<h3>What is Skyscanner?</h3>
					<p><a href="https://www.skyscanner.com.ua/" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a> is a flight search engine. To be more general, they are an online travel search engine, since they also let you book a hotel and rent a car. The website is entirely free to use. There are neither hidden fees or additional expenses: the prices you see are the ones you will pay. Skyscanner searches airlines and online travel agents’ websites by displaying the cheapest flight deals in under 30 seconds.</p>

						<p>Education can be divide into stages of different tasks for different subjects. The school publishes the task, divided into points, which significantly simplifies the work on it. There are educational lectures online, where you can ask questions lecturer or later watch the video in the recording. The school regularly conducts tests to identify gaps in knowledge.</p>

					<h3>During the training, we did:</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Calculator — without using the eval() function;</li>
						<li>Momentum — with using localStorage and API requests;</li>
						<li>Virtual keyboard — work with keyboard and mouse events;</li>
						<li>Game puzzle — drag and drop effects and algorithm for automatically end the game;</li>

						<h3>Before starting the project, we made a scheme of pages and blocks and how they will interact with each other:</h3>

						<aside class="notes">
							<!-- Help notes for speaker -->
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Based on this scheme, we divided the work into parts and functionality.</p>
						<img src="./assets/images/5.png" alt="Main page header">
						<aside class="notes">
							<!-- Help notes for speaker -->
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Using IP Address Lookup, we identify and display the user’s location. Depending on the country, we also set the currency. The user can change this data at any time.</p>
						<p>There is also a log in button that invites the user to log in or register in the system.</p>
						<p>On the registration page, the user fills out the form. When the form is filled correctly, the user can apply the data and get a notification about the registration status.</p>
						<aside class="notes">

						<h4>Registration Page</h4>

						<h4>Search Form</h4>

					<section>
						<p>For tickets search, we use the <a href="https://tequila.kiwi.com/" target="_blank">Tequila API</a>. To start the search, you need to choose a one-way ticket or return, enter the country, city, or airport IATA code, dates, and the number of passengers. When entering data in the fields FROM and TO, the user is offered input options depending on his location or the entered characters.</p>
						<aside class="notes">

						<h4>Tequila API</h4>
						<img src="./assets/images/8.png" alt="Tequila API">
						<aside class="notes">
							<!-- Help notes for speaker -->
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>By default, tickets are sorted by price from lowest to highest. Users also can apply filters to get better results and check the details of each ticket option and choose the best one.</p>
						<p>The user must enter an email to confirm the reservation. After confirmation, we will send an email with the information that we cannot book a ticket because we can’t ensure the protection of user data.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<!-- Help notes for speaker -->
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Also, we made a live map with the latest information about COVID-19 we think it’s importantly for people who plan to travel abroad. The user selects the country of departure, by choosing the country of interest on the map, he can read up-to-date restrictions on entry and return.</p>
						<aside class="notes">

						<h4>COVID-19 Map with travel information</h4>

						<aside class="notes">

					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The program remembers each user search, and if he hasn’t confirmed the ticket reservation, we offer him to return to and continue it. And also, check out popular destinations.</p>
						<p>If you want to check whether we show up-to-date tickets and prices, we recommend using <a href="https://www.kiwi.com/" target="_blank">kiwi.com</a>.</p>
						<p>For work together, we used messages in Discord, several times we called to discuss tasks.</p>

						<h3>The difficulties we faced:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>In the beginning, we planned to use Skyscanner API for flight ticket search through the site <a href="https://rapidapi.com/" target="_blank">rapidapi.com</a>, which provides a free API-Key. But we realized that they gave access only to cached results, not live. After a long search, we decided to use the Tequila API.</li>
						</ol>
						<aside class="notes">
							<!-- Help notes for speaker -->
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ol start="2">
							<li>We use the Mysql database to collect data on registered users. The difficulty was connecting the Mysql database to the Heroku server because, by default, Heroku provides a PostgreSQL. Problem solved by hours of trying and googling, and for work Mysql on Heroku we used the application ClearDB.</li>
						</ol>
